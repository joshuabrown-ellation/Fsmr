# Fsmr
Finite State Machine General Purpose Library

It's a simple, robust, restricted mode Finite State Machine written in Javascript.  With some work it could be a lot smaller and more useful.

## Todo's, Nice to haves:
- Methods should be able to accept strings AND/OR objects as parameters.  Then chaining becomes possible meaningfully, and the code might end up smaller for it.
